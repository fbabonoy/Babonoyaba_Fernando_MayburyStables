# CAPSTONE - MaybutyStables

## Capstone Objective
Create a full-stack web application using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node (MERN).**

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview
MaybutyStables is a website that provides information and booking capabilities for horseback riding services. The website is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

### Features
The website will have the following features:

- A homepage that provides an overview of the services offered and a call to action to visit the booking page.
- An about page that provides information about the company and its mission.
- A booking page that allows users to select a date and time for their horseback ride, select the type of ride they want, and input their contact information.
- A reviews page that displays reviews from previous customers.
- An admin page that allows the website administrator to add and remove services, and view and manage bookings.

### Your presentation should include:
1. A demonstration of the application.
2. An overview of the challenges you endured, and how you handled them.
3. A short question-and-answer period.

## Finishing Up
As you finish building your application, ask yourself the following questions:
- Did you deliver a project that met all of the technical requirements?
- Given what the class has covered, did you build something reasonably complex?
- Did you add a personal touch or a creative element into your project submission?
- Did you deliver something of value to the end-user (not just a login button and an index page)?
- Did you follow the code style guidance and exercise best practices?
- Did you provide an appropriate level of comments?
- Did you try to deploy your application to a public URL as a personal stretch goal?

**The following section is NOT included in the requirements for this project.** Completing this section is NOT required. This section will NOT negatively impact your grade if left unfinished.

This section is intended for learners looking to go the extra mile by showcasing additional skills such as project management and optional technologies like TypeScript.

You must complete **ALL** other requirements to receive credit for this section; however, this extra credit will not be included if you have already received the maximum 100% grade. The extra credit can only offset points lost elsewhere.

## (5%) Extra Credit
